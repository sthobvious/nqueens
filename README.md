# N Queens 

A program to calculate Queens on a chessboard!

## Description

This project calculates every solution to the famous Queens Problem,  i.e., how many Queens can one fit on a chessboard in a way so they do not endanger another? The program asks the user for a chessboard size, and uses that to calculate every possible configuration for that chessboard size. It utilizes backtracking and memoization to optimize the processes as the chessboard could grow larger!
